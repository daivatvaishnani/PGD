Statistics Essentials
    Inferential Statistics
        Expected value
            roll a dice 10 times
            EV(x) = x1*P(x = x1) + x2*P(x = x2) + ... + x3*P(x = x3)
        Discrete Probability Distributions
            A coin flip
        Continuous Probability Distributions
            commute time of an upgrad employee
        Measure of Central Tendency
        Central Limit Theorem
            high number of samples (>= 30)
                sampling dist mean = population mean 
                sampling dist std dev = population std dev / sqrt(n)
                sampling dist becomes normal dist
                
    Hypothesis Testing
        Formulate null/alternate hypothesis
            null (=, >=, <=)
            alternate (!=, >, <)
        p-values, z-values, upper critical/ lower critical values, etc.
        upper tailed, lower tailed

incubate a habit
	after finishing a module, learn about advanced stuff in module
	analyticsvidya, towardsdatascience, machinelearningmastery

projects
	kaggle/goggle datasets, explore gaming related datasets, rockstar games, pubg
	download these and apply what you learned (different types of models)
	nlp -> 	extract live data (tweets) from twitter, analysing it
			Twitter developer API, tweepy, extract tweets containing Farmville, #Farmville, #Zynga, @Zynga
			once data extracted, perform text cleaning
			perform sentiment analysis, positive/negative/neutral
			dig deeper into negative sentiment tweets
			extract location, reasons, etc.
	ml ->	start interacting with data analysts teams at Zynga
	dl ->	take up a project on computer vision (opencv)
			kaggle, covid masks build classifier using tensorflow
			how game bots have been developed, how they're defeating human brains

how do you learn concepts not covered in course?
	scanning through kernels in kaggle
	learn other data visualizing tools apart from matplotlib/seaborn like plotly

1. Data Cleaning
    1. Missing Data:
        1. Identify the sets of categorical and continuous variables.
        2. Find out percentage of nulls for various columns.
        3. Indentify meaningful missing and impute with zero.
            1. No of recharges, no of calls made, etc.
        4. Drop columns with high missing percentage (aything more than 70-80%, there are 30 columns like this)
        5. For less missing % variables, impute
        6. Fancy compute

2. Filter high value customers (80-20 rule, focus on top 20%)
    1. We will build our model for high value customers
    2. 90% revenue is there from 30% customers
    3. We will only use 6th and 7th month data to filter
    4. High value customers are people with high total recharge amount.

3. Derive Churn (this column is not available)
    1. User 9th month data
    2. figure out by total incoming and outgoing minutes of usage
    3. After deriving churn you can remove all the 9th month variables

4. Do EDA

5. Modelling

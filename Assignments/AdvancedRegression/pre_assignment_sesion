Missing with some meaning
    Garage Quality, alley, etc.
    Here null means there is no alley, no garage
    so they are null but they still have some meaning
    
    Drop columns that don't have good information content
        Lets say if 90% of data is falling to one category than that variable doesn't have much information
        Here alley is such categorical variable, 90% houses have no alley, we can drop such columns

Artificial Outliers
    data entry issue
    treat them as missing values
Natural outliers
    naturally occuring, salary of CEO
    to treat them:
        transform such columns, e.g. convert salary to log(salary)
        scaling, min-max, standardize
        
Encoding categorical data
    if we have binary variable, male-female, spam-ham then assign 0-1 (label encoding)
    if we have ordinal data, small-medium-large-xl, then we cann do 1-2-3-4 (label encoding)
    if we have nominal data, green-red-brown-black, then we cannot order it and we create dummies (one hot encoding)
        in creating dummies, we use drop-first to avoid multi-collinearity because here one col can always be derived from others

Removing imbalance in data (Read about over-sampling and under-sampling)
    Positivity rate in Covid-19 is 4.5%
        In dataset of 100 people, 5 people are positive and 95 people are negative
        If we consider this dataset to develop a model on predicitng positivity
             Even if we take a horrible model that always predicts negative then also we can get an accuracy of 0.95
             We should try to remove this kind of imbalance while developing a model to avoid that
    Generally, we have efficient infrastructures (AWS etc.) that generally we don't require to do modelling on samples
